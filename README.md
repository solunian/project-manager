# project-manager

I'm kinda just learning rust with this because apparently it's a good language. 😁

## Dev Notes
- use `cargo run -- <arg1> <arg2> ...` to use command line args without calling cargo's options

- similar to git with a terminal-based interface
- use a dot folder for tracking stuff
- show statistics and progression for things - cool terminal colors!
- "hat trick" for doing finishing three things in a row
- inspiration from Jiaming from his PioneerHacks III project lol
