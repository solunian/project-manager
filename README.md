A command-line project manager.

I'm kinda just learning rust with this because apparently it's a good language. üòÅ

## Ideas

- similar to git with a terminal-based interface
- use a dot folder for tracking stuff, maybe global?
- show statistics and progression for things - cool terminal colors!
- "hat trick" for doing finishing three things in a row
- inspiration from Jiaming from his PioneerHacks III project lol

### Features

- create separate projects
  - globally accessible projects or local to specific directory/repo
- git-able?
- assignments/work for each project
  - deadlines, progress bar, item status, team members assignments??
- status tracking
  - kanaban table? gantt chart??
- stats on productivity
- log of changes
- configs for behavior??
- teams??


## Dev Notes

- use `cargo run -- <arg1> <arg2> ...` to use command line args without calling cargo's options
- do not use periods in single sentence messages
- the number of `match` statements I've used is outrageous
